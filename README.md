# Scope:

The organisation is currently facing challenges with its existing invoicing process and seeks to enhance its system to facilitate a streamlined two-step solution for car sales while automating the invoice generation process. The primary objective is to empower the organisational administrators to efficiently assess the available inventory of cars in their database and simultaneously generate comprehensive invoices containing pertinent customer and car information. Furthermore, this automated invoicing mechanism should seamlessly dispatch email notifications to both the customers and administrators.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. **Car Sales Management System:**
    - Develop a robust and user-friendly web-based interface for organisational administrators to manage the sale of cars.
    - Integrate the system with a database containing up-to-date information about available cars, including details such as make, model, price, and availability status.
2. **Automated Invoice Generation and Distribution:**
    - Implement an automated invoicing module within the Car Sales Management System.
    - Upon selecting a car for sale, the system will trigger the automatic generation of invoices that include relevant customer information (e.g., name, contact details) and car information (e.g., make, model, price).
    - The automated invoicing generation will be based on predefined templates, ensuring consistency and professionalism in every invoice.
    - The system will also support customisable invoice templates to accommodate specific branding and legal requirements.
    - Automated email notifications will be sent to both the customer and the administrative team, containing the generated invoice as an attachment. These notifications will confirm the transaction and provide a record of the sale.
